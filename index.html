          Hello, I am Jang Yena, a graphic designer from Korea. <br />When you
          connect the dots of a person's past and present, you can see the line
          <br />that connects their past passions and how they have led to the
          present. <br />Also, by extending this line of past and present into
          the future, I would like to share <br />what kind of future you can
          expect when working with me.

          <h2>Who you were?</h2>
          <p>
            At the age of 16,I was a bit different from those around me. During
            my school years, I saw textbooks not as a means to perform well on
            exams but as a gateway to discovering new thoughts in the world. I
            started with textbooks, adding annotations and creating mind maps,
            often moved to tears by something that fascinated me secretly during
            class (Researching mind maps alone during middle and high school -
            698 sheets). Teachers suggested that I would have been better off
            born in France. This planted a dream of Europe, representing the
            unknown to me, and a deep desire to explore the unvisited France.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="content_section">
          <h2>How did you end up in Europe?</h2>
          <p>
            At the age of 21, after going through academic pursuits that did not
            align with me, I became an English instructor at an academy teaching
            middle and high school students. I believed that studying English
            would help me solidify the dream of Europe that had been vague since
            my childhood. However, being curious beyond the given textbooks, the
            role of an English teacher felt dull to me, so I embarked on my
            first solo trip to Europe.
          </p>
          <p>
            Although I didn't know much about Europe, I first arrived in the
            'France' that I often heard about in my childhood. I visited art
            boulevards in France and struck up conversations with people there.
            While staying at the house of an art student named Juliet in the
            city of Lyon, I decided to study art in Europe after talking all
            night about art and Europe. Although I didn't have the opportunity
            to visit the Netherlands directly, Juliet, through friends, was
            well-informed about Dutch design, art, and life. Intrigued by the
            experimental and artistic design of the Netherlands and its
            international and English-friendly environment, I applied to the
            Graphic Design program at KABK after returning from my trip to
            France.

          <h2>What do I pursue meaning?</h2>
          <p>
            At the age of 26, every year-end, I take some time to reflect on the
            year by quietly enjoying a half-body bath. In the midst of busy
            days, it is challenging to find time for in-depth contemplation of
            long-term goals or values. However, during the year-end, I take a
            few days to write down the ideas in my mind on a large A0-sized
            canvas, organizing my thoughts. Clear values enable me to make
            decisions that are true to myself in various situations, so I try to
            summarize them as a motto for the new year and write them on the
            window to remind myself. In 2024, I plan to engrave the following
            meanings more deeply:

          <h2>What am I interested in?</h2>
          <p>
            At the age of 23, I had found the direction of design I should
            pursue in my very personal life. I had a keen interest in "Memory."
            Knowing my own identity, I realized that stories only about me, as
            commercial experiences, were not what I wanted. My memory is a
            narrative, incomplete but full. The memories I keep in my heart,
            constantly changing and evolving, are what I want to express through
            design. I want to create works that are not just visually appealing
            but also meaningful, resonating with the memories and experiences of
            others.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="content_section">
          <h2>What design do I pursue?</h2>
          <p>
            Personally, I do not believe that design will save the world. While
            there are occasional moments where design can solve the problems
            existing in the world, the role of a designer is to explore and
            express the beauty and meaning of life. I want to create designs
            that are not just functional but also evoke emotions and tell
            stories. For the past few years, I have been exploring various
            fields of design, from graphic design to product design. I want to
            be a designer who not only creates beautiful and functional works
            but also makes people think and feel. My goal is to create designs
            that are not just visually appealing but also meaningful and
            thought-provoking.

          <h2>Graduation plans?</h2>
          <p>
            Whatever I want to achieve, I want to enjoy it. When I am faced with
            a question like the one I faced at the age of 17, I want to be able
            to answer it with confidence. I believe that design is not just
            about creating visually appealing works but also about understanding
            the world and its various forms, trying to find meaning in it. I
            plan to continue this journey of exploration and reflection in the
            years to come. After graduation, I want to work in a field where I
            can apply my knowledge and skills as a designer.
