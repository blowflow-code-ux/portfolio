          <h2>Who you were?</h2>
          <p>
            At the age of 3, I was a bit different from those around me. During
            my school years, I saw textbooks not as a means to perform well on
            exams but as a gateway to discovering new thoughts in the world. I
            started with notebooks, adding annotations and drawing what came to
            mind, more to learn by transforming the information stored in my
            head into something better than a mere transcript. I had long
            suspected that I could have been better off born in France. This
            gifted me a dream of living, experiencing the unknown to me, and my
            desire to explore the world outside France.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="content_section">
          <h2>How did you end up in Europe?</h2>
          <p>
            At the age of 17, after going through academic pursuits that did not
            align with me, I became an English instructor at an academy.
            Standing amidst frustrated students, I believed that the skills I
            taught were not solely limited to English but had been designed to
            inspire and guide minds, much like my early attempts to find Europe.
          </p>
          <p>
            Although I didn't immediately head to Europe, I found that the path
            I often heard about, the inherent value of breaking away and
            understanding the world, did exist. I experienced this when I
            started breaking into freelance translation. At the age of 19, when
            I had my first translation job, I was given a plane ticket to
            France. I thought, "This is it," and I went to France. After
            returning from my trip to France, I applied to the Graphic Design
            program and started pursuing my dream.

        <div class="content_section">
          <h2>What do I pursue meaning?</h2>
          <p>
            At the age of 23, every week, I take some time to reflect on the
            year by quietly exploring the world of books. I enjoy this,
            discovering the different fields of design that can be applied to my
            work. I believe that design is not just about creating visually
            appealing works but also about understanding the world and its
            various forms, trying to find meaning in it. I plan to continue this
            journey of exploration and reflection in the years to come.

          <h2>What am I interested in?</h2>
          <p>
            At the age of 23, I had found the direction of design I should
            pursue in my very personal life. I had a keen interest in "Memory."
            Knowing my own identity, I realized that stories only about me, as
            commercial experiences, were not what I wanted. My memory is a
            narrative, incomplete but full. The memories I keep in my heart,
            constantly changing and evolving, are what I want to express through
            design. I want to create works that are not just visually appealing
            but also meaningful, resonating with the memories and experiences of
            others.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="content_section">
          <h2>What design do I pursue?</h2>
          <p>
            Personally, I do not believe that design will save the world. While
            there are occasional moments where design can solve the problems
            existing in the world, the role of a designer is to explore and
            express the beauty and meaning of life. I want to create designs
            that are not just functional but also evoke emotions and tell
            stories. For the past few years, I have been exploring various
            fields of design, from graphic design to product design. I want to
            be a designer who not only creates beautiful and functional works
            but also makes people think and feel. My goal is to create designs
            that are not just visually appealing but also meaningful and
            thought-provoking.

          <h2>Graduation plans?</h2>
          <p>
            Whatever I want to achieve, I want to enjoy it. When I am faced with
            a question like the one I faced at the age of 17, I want to be able
            to answer it with confidence. I believe that design is not just
            about creating visually appealing works but also about understanding
            the world and its various forms, trying to find meaning in it. I
            plan to continue this journey of exploration and reflection in the
            years to come. After graduation, I want to work in a field where I
            can apply my knowledge and skills as a designer.
